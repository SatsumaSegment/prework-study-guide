# Pre-work Study Guide Website

## Description

This project is a webpage which contains useful notes related to HTML, CSS,
Git and JavaScript. I built this webpage to have notes to refer to
during the course of my Frontend Bootcamp Course.

During this project, I learned how to create a simple webpage with CSS styling and JavaScript functionality. I learned how to link CSS and JavaScript files to an HTML file as well as some CSS styling tags and how to create Javascript function.
